# patchdirector
sound repository from all kind of synths -virtual instrument or hardware
Patchdirector is a unique, intuitive and easy-to-use sound archive and audio manager for your own sounds and presets. 
You can share all samples, protect them from abuse with an audio watermark, load shared samples easily, tag them, sort them... and much more. 

Patchdirector is a program for recording, previewing and managing sound patches and presets. 
You can save your own creations (instruments, banks, presets). 
But you can also access prepared lists and audio samples if you import them.
In addition, groups/collections can be formed from different models and banks, which can be shared as exported container files or MP3 files.
Composing your songs and collaborating with others becomes more diverse, faster, and most importantly: much easier.

Patchdirector is not present on social media.
